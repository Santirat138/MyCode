Insert duplicate of K adjacent to it for it’s every occurrence in array
Given an array arr consisting of N integers and an integer K, 
the task is to insert an adjacent K for every occurrence of it in the original sequence and then truncate the array to the original length using an O(1) auxiliary space.

Examples:  


Input: arr[] = {1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0}, K = 0 
Output: {1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4} 
Explanation: 
The given array {1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 5, 0} is modified to {1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 4} after insertion of two 0’s and truncation of extra elements.


Input: arr[] = {7, 5, 8}, K = 8 
Output: {7, 5, 8} 
Explanation: 
After inserting an adjacent 8 into the array, it got truncated to restore the original size of the array.
